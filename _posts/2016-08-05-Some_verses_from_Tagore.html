  <div class="stackedit__html"><p>Be resolute and stand up; don’t sway from side to side<br>
Don’t drive away grace and fortune by worrying endlessly<br>
Decide firmly on a course; drifting is worse than death<br>
Don’t keep playing the game of swaying from side to side<br>
Whether you find a gem or not you’ll have to keep trying—<br>
If what you get is not what you desired, don’t shed tears<br>
Float your boat if you have to but don’t keep dithering<br>
Don’t open your eyes when the light has already faded!<!-- more --></p>
<p>No, don’t be afraid, you’ll surely win and doors will open<br>
I know the chains that bind you will break again and again<br>
Often you’ll lose yourself and stay awake all night<br>
Again and again you’ll regain your right to be in the world<br>
Earth and sea will beckon you; communities will call you too<br>
You will have music in you in happiness, sorrow, shame and fear<br>
Flowers and leaves, rivers and waterfalls will sing along with you<br>
The rhythm of your being will pulsate in light and darkness!</p>
<p>Keep faith, day and night, O heart, things will work out<br>
If you’ve made a pledge, it will surely be fulfilled<br>
O my heart, such things will surely happen<br>
That which lies like stone, will come to life<br>
Those who are dumb now will surely speak again<br>
It’s time to act and remove your burden<br>
If you confront your sorrow it surely will be bearable.<br>
When the bell rings you’ll see everyone join in eagerly<br>
All travelers will traverse the same path together then!</p>
