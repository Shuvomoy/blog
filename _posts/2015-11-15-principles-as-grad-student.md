As a graduate student I try to follow some principles, which I have developed gradually over the last one year. I have found them to be helpful in my growth as a graduate student. I am posting them here; I will revisit and update them as time progresses.

**Time management.** This is probably the most important skill a graduate student needs to develop. If you are a graduate student, you have lot of freedom in creating your own schedule. While this is an amazing luxury most 9 to 5 jobs would not offer, it also lacks a clear structure, and, if not handled properly, can lead to a lot of procrastination. So, as a graduate student you have to impose that structure and organize your life accordingly.

* It is important to schedule the day in a way which is doable. Surprisingly, 5-6 hours of work per day can be very productive. Now when I say 5-6 hours, it has to be 5-6 hours of real work (checking Facebook every 15 minutes does not count).

* Have both long term visions and short term goals. Based on them, try to make a realistic schedule for the day on the night before. Once you have made the schedule, try to stick to it as much as possible. Making a realistic schedule and following it honestly can get a lot done. Allow yourself to take planned breaks in the schedule.

* Have a feedback system for your scheduling. At the end of the day, see how much of the original schedule you followed. This will not only provide you valuable feedback, but will also help you to better manage your time in future.

**Relax.** Go to social events. Hang out with your friends. Go to the gym. Meditate. No matter what your preferred way of relaxing is, remember to refresh and recharge yourself regularly after you are done with your work.

**Do not stop learning.** Keep learning new material. This is very important. After you are done with your courses, you will have lot of free time. Try to self-study material that may be relevant to your research in this free time. This may help you to bring fresh perspective to your own research. Also, learning just for the sake of learning can be a lot of fun.

**Teach to learn.** Surprisingly, teaching may be the best way to learn something and retain the material in long term. If you are learning new material, then try to find friends who are interested in similar topic and form a discussion group. It serves two purposes. *First,* running a discussion group is a commitment that will keep you going and motivate you to learn the material thoroughly. *Second,* your friends can learn the material in the process, which gives your learning a sense of purpose. For sure this is more fulfilling rather than studying just for yourself.

**Have patience.** Patience is a great virtue, at least for a graduate student. There are projects for which there may not be any noticeable progress in short term. But after 3-4 months of consistent effort, you would see noticeable change. Be persistent, patience attains the goal.

**Talk to other people.** Talk to other people, including professors, post doctoral fellows and of course graduate students, even those not in your field. Though the professors are busy, surprisingly often they will give you time generously. You may get valuable research ideas just by talking to them.

**Help others.** Opportunity to help others is a great privilege. You would often run into people who need your help - in academia and outside academia. Try to help them to the best of your capabilities. Do not expect anything in return. Life is not only about working towards achieving your own personal goals. The attitude of helping people selflessly benefits you as well, it makes you a better human being in long run.

**Accept your failures humbly and learn from them.** Inevitably there will be many failures along the way. In spite of your best effort, there will be projects where you will fail miserably, sometimes because of your own flaws, sometimes for reasons beyond your control. When this happens, do not get upset. Try to accept the failures humbly and learn from them. Unlike success, failure forces you to analyze yourself and shows you the way to better yourself.
