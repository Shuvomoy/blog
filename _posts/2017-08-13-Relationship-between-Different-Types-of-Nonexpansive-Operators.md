Anyone interested in convex optimization theory knows the importance of nonexpansiveness of operators. Though nonexpansiveness comes in many forms, averaged operators connect all of them together. <!-- more -->Recently I was reviewing monotone operator theory for running a discussion group from next month and noticed that the interrelation of different types of nonexpansive operators can be shown in a neat block diagram.

The block diagram can be shown as follows:
