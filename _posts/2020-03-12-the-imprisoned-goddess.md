আকাশলীনা (Literal translation: the woman who merges into the heavens) is one of the most famous poems of [Jibanananda Das](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jibanananda_Das). I am deeply influenced by Das's style, and I have often tried to mimic the quietness of his poetry in my writing, fruitlessly.  <!-- more -->

Recently, I reread his collection সাতটি তারার তিমির  (Darkness of the seven stars), where the poem first appeared and found it quite relevant in the context of my life. Though this is considered a simple poem compared to his other works, to my mind, it works on so many levels!

In the poem, the poet addresses his beloved as সুরঞ্জনা (Suranjana); a mysterious word with its roots in Sanskrit. I do not know Sanskrit well enough. However, I read somewhere that Suranjana means an imprisoned goddess or princess, which works flawlessly in the curvature of space and time where I reside. 

So, here is my unsuccessful attempt to translate this beautiful poem. I apologize in advance for my poor English and perhaps for butchering a beautiful poem; I wish I were capable of expressing my feelings in English properly.

### The imprisoned goddess

My imprisoned goddess, please do not go to that corner!
Do not talk to that guy: this is what I prefer!
Please come back, princess;
In this starry night filled with silvery fire.

Please come back to this wavefield;
With all my heart, I await you here;
But it seems that our distance is only growing -
With that guy, are you going somewhere?

What are  you talking about? With *that* guy!
In the heavens beyond the sky
You are perhaps the earth;
His love turns into the meadow. 

My goddess,
Today your heart is that meadow:
The heavens beyond the sky---
The breeze beyond the wind.

I must admit that the fourth line of the third stanza eludes my understanding. I read this poem when I was around ten perhaps and understood nothing, of course. Today, I have started to realize the purport of this poem. But, the meaning of this one line still eludes me. 

Here is the original poem:

### আকাশলীনা

সুরঞ্জনা, ওইখানে যেওনাকো তুমি,
বোলোনাকো কথা ওই যুবকের সাথে;
ফিরে এসো সুরঞ্জনা:
নক্ষত্রের রুপালি আগুন ভরা রাতে;

ফিরে এসো এই মাঠে, ঢেউয়ে;
ফিরে এসো হৃদয়ে আমার;
দূর থেকে দূরে— আরো দূরে
যুবকের সাথে তুমি যেওনাকো আর।

কি কথা তাহার সাথে? তার সাথে!
আকাশের আড়ালে আকাশে
মৃত্তিকার মতো তুমি আজ:
তার প্রেম ঘাস হয়ে আসে।

সুরঞ্জনা,
তোমার হৃদয় আজ ঘাস:
বাতাসের ওপারে বাতাস—
আকাশের ওপারে আকাশ।
