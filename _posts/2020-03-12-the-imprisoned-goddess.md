আকাশলীনা (Literal translation: the woman who merges into the heavens) is one of the most famous poems of [Jibanananda Das](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jibanananda_Das). I am deeply influenced by Das's style, and I have often tried to mimic the quietness of his poetry in my writing, fruitlessly.  <!-- more -->

Recently, I reread his collection [সাতটি তারার তিমির ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18177720) (Darkness of the seven stars), where the poem first appeared. Though this is considered a simple poem compared to his other works, to my mind, it works on so many levels!

In the poem, the poet addresses his beloved as সুরঞ্জনা (Suranjana); a mysterious word with its roots in Sanskrit. I do not know Sanskrit well enough. However, I read somewhere that Suranjana means an imprisoned goddess or princess. 

So, here is my unsuccessful attempt to translate this beautiful poem. I apologize in advance for my poor English and perhaps for butchering a beautiful poem; I wish I were capable of expressing my feelings in English properly.

### The imprisoned goddess

My imprisoned goddess, please do not go to that corner!  
Do not talk to that guy: this is what I prefer!  
Please come back, princess;  
In this starry night filled with silvery fire.  

Please come back to this wavefield;  
With all my heart, I await you here;  
But it seems that our distance is only growing---  
With that guy, are you going somewhere?  

What are  you talking about? With *that* guy!  
In the heavens beyond the sky  
You are perhaps the earth;  
His love turns into the meadow.$^\star$     

My goddess,  
Today your heart is that meadow: 
The breeze beyond the wind---   
The heavens beyond the sky.

**$^\star$** I must admit that the fourth line of the third stanza eludes my understanding. I read this poem when I was around ten perhaps and understood nothing, of course. Today, I have started to realize the purport of this poem. But, the meaning of this one line still eludes me. 

Here is the original poem:

### আকাশলীনা

সুরঞ্জনা, ওইখানে যেওনাকো তুমি,  
বোলোনাকো কথা ওই যুবকের সাথে;  
ফিরে এসো সুরঞ্জনা:  
নক্ষত্রের রুপালি আগুন ভরা রাতে;  

ফিরে এসো এই মাঠে, ঢেউয়ে;  
ফিরে এসো হৃদয়ে আমার;  
দূর থেকে দূরে— আরো দূরে  
যুবকের সাথে তুমি যেওনাকো আর।  
 
কি কথা তাহার সাথে? তার সাথে!   
আকাশের আড়ালে আকাশে  
মৃত্তিকার মতো তুমি আজ:  
তার প্রেম ঘাস হয়ে আসে।  
 
সুরঞ্জনা,  
তোমার হৃদয় আজ ঘাস:  
বাতাসের ওপারে বাতাস—  
আকাশের ওপারে আকাশ।
