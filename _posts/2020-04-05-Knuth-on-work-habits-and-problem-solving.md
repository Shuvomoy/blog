Recently, I came across an old interview of [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) conducted in 1996, where he sheds light on his work habits and how he approaches problems. I really enjoyed reading the interview. In this blog, I am recording his thoughts on approaching a problem, organizing daily activities, and other research related things. <!-- more -->


##### Donald Knuth on Work Habits and Problem Solving



**Seeing both the forest and the trees in research.** "I've seen many graduate students working on their theses, over the years, and their research often follows a pattern that supports what I'm trying to explain. Suppose you want to solve a complicated problem whose solution is unknown; in essence you're an explorer entering into a new world. At first your brain is learning the territory, and you're making tiny steps, baby steps in the world of the problem. But after you've immersed yourself in that problem for awhile then you can start to make giant steps, bigger steps, and you can see many things at once, so your brain is getting ready for a new kind of work. You begin to see both the forest and the trees."



**How Knuth works on a project.** "When I start to investigate some topic, during the first days I fill up scratch paper like mad. I mean, I have a huge pile of paper at home, paper that's half-used, used on only one side; I've kept a lot of partially printed sheets instead of throwing them away, so that I can write on the back sides. And I'll use up 20 sheets or more per hour when I'm exploring a problem, especially at the beginning. For the first hour I'm trying all kinds of stuff and looking for patterns. Later, after internalizing those calculations or drawings or whatever they are, I don't have to write quite so much down, and I'm getting closer to a solution. The best test of when I'm about ready to solve a problem is whether or not I can think about it sensibly while swimming, without any paper or notes to help out. Because my mind is getting accustomed to the territory, and finally I can see what might possibly lead to the end. That's oversimplifying the truth a little bit, but the main idea is that, with all my students, I've noticed that they get into a mental state where they've become more familiar with a certain problem area than anybody else in the world."



**What graduate students should do when they have expertise in a certain area.** "When they [the students] reach this point [expertise in a certain area] I always tell them that now they have a responsibility to the rest of us. Namely, after they have solved their thesis problem and trained their brain for this problem area, they should look around for other, similar problems that require the same expertise. They should use their expertise now, while they have this unique ability, because they're going to lose it in a month. I emphasize that they shouldn't be satisfied with solving only one problem; they should also be thinking about other interesting problems that could be handled with the same methods."



**On the importance of anthropomorphizing a problem.** "Another aspect of role playing is considerably more important: We can often make advances by anthropomorphizing a problem, by saying that certain of its aspects are "bad guys" and others are "good guys," or that parts of a system are "talking to each other." This approach is helpful because our language has lots of words for human relationships, so we can bring more machinery to bear on what we're thinking about."



**Why putting the discovery of a solution on paper is important.** "Well, I have no sympathy with people who never write up an answer; it's selfish to keep beautiful discoveries a secret. But I can understand a reluctance to write something up when another problem has already grabbed your attention. I used to have three or four papers always in sort of a pipeline, waiting for their ideas to mature before I would finally prepare them for publication.

Frances Yao once described the situation very nicely. She said, you work very hard on a problem for a long time, and then you get this rush, this wonderful satisfaction when you've solved it. That lasts about *an hour*. And then you think of another problem, and you're consumed with curiosity about the answer to that new one. Again, your life isn't happy until you find the next answer."



**The philosophy behind seeking solutions.** "The process of seeking solutions is certainly a big part of a researcher's life, but really it's in everybody's life. I don't want to get deep into philosophy, but the book of Ecclesiastes in the Bible says  essentially this:

> Life is hard and then you die. You can, however, enjoy the process of living; don't worry about the fact that you're going to die. Some bad people have a good life, and some good people have a bad life, and that doesn't seem fair; but don't worry about that either. Just think about ways of enjoying the journey.

Again I'm oversimplifying, but that's the message I find in many parts of the Bible. For example, it turns up in Philippians 3:16, where the writer says that:

> You don't race to get to the goal; the process of racing itself, of keeping the pace, is the real goal.  

When I go on vacation, I like to enjoy the drive.

In Christian churches I am least impressed by a sermon that talks about how marvelous heaven is going to be at the end. To me that's not the message of Christianity. The message is about how to live now, not that we should live in some particular way because there's going to be pie in the sky some day. The end means almost nothing to me. I am glad it's there, but I don't see it as much of a motivating force, if any. I mean, it's the journey that's important."



**Knuth's process of reading papers.** "It turns out that I read everything at the same slow rate, whether I'm looking at light fiction or at highly technical papers. When I browse through a journal, the titles and abstracts of papers usually don't help me much, because they emphasize results rather than methods; therefore I generally go through page by page, looking at the illustrations, also looking for equations that are somehow familiar or for indications of useful techniques that are unfamiliar.

Usually a paper lies outside the scope of my books, because I've promised to write about only a rather small part of the entire field of computer science. In such cases there's nothing new for me to worry about, and I happily turn the pages, zipping to the end. But when I do find a potentially relevant paper, I generally read it only partway, only until I know where it fits into the table of contents of *The Art of Computer Programming*. Then I make myself a note, to read it later when I'm writing up that section. Sometimes, however—as happened last night with that paper about scheduling games of bridge—I get hooked on some question and try to explore it before I'm ready to move on to reading any other papers.

Eventually when I do begin to write a section of my book, I go into "batch mode" and read all of the literature for which my files point to that section, as well as all of the papers that those papers cite. I save considerable time by reading several dozen papers on the same topic all in the same week, rather than reading them one by one as they come out and trying to keep infinitely many things in my head all at once.

When I finally do get into batch mode, I go very carefully through the first two or three papers, trying to work the concepts out in my own mind and to anticipate what the authors are going to say before turning each page. I usually fail to guess what the next page holds, but the fact that I've tried and failed makes me more ready to understand why the authors chose the paths that they did. Frequently I'll also write little computer programs at this point, so that the ideas solidify in my head. Then, once I've gone slowly through the first few papers that I've accumulated about some topic, I can usually breeze through the others at a comparatively high speed. It's like the process of starting with baby steps and progressing to giant steps that I described earlier."



**On parts of research that are much less fun.** "Well, some parts of a job are always much less fun than others. But I've learned to grin and bear it, to bite the bullet and move on, to face the music, to take it in stride and make a virtue of necessity. (Excuse me for using so many clichés, but the number of different popular expressions tends to make my point.)"



**On scheduling daily activities.** "I schedule my activities in a somewhat peculiar way. Every day I look at the things that I'm ready to do, and choose the one that I like the least, the one that's least fun — the task that I would most like to procrastinate from doing, but for which I have no good reason for procrastination. This scheduling rule is paradoxical because you might think that I'm never enjoying my work at all; but precisely the opposite is the case, because I like to finish a project. It feels good to know that I've gotten through the hurdles."
